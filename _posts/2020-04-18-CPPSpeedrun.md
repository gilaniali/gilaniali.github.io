# Udacity C++ Nanodegree Speedrun
------

On April 15th, [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com) launched a free month for most of their Nanodegrees. Generally I think the cost of a Nanodegree is **WAY** too high - especially with Coursera being $60 per month.

But free is hard to pass up and I did want to add C++ to my skillset. So for the next 30 days I am going to attempt a speedrun. I am going to try to finish the lessons, the assignments & Capstone in 4 weeks. The focus is on finishing the lessons so even if I run out at the end I can have a general idea on how C++ works.

I am not a complete beginner - I learnt Python and R at university and write up scripts in VBA (badly) for my day job as a Financial Analyst. For the past week I had started learning javascript with plans to learn React and Node but these plans will be kept on slow mode till I get this done. 

**Stay safe everyone!**
